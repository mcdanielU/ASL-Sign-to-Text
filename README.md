<h1>American sign Language to text conversion</h1>

<h2>Most deaf communities globally rely on sign language for communication with other people. Currently only few people can serve as interpreters to the non-deaf community when passing messages. Fortunately, by advancement in field of artificial intelligence, deep
learning and in particular convolutional neural network (CNN)
has been contributing enormously in image processing and
object detection due to their outstanding performance. For this project, YOLOv5 is used for real time object tracking.

<h2> This project only requires pytorch deep learning framework with preprcoessed data extracted data from roboflow. The remaining dependencies are written in each cell and needs to be run</h2>
